# Logos

Drop your logo file here:

- `logo.png` - Main logo (recommended size: 32x32 or higher resolution square/circular logo)

The logo is used in the Navigation component and will automatically appear once you add the file.

If you have different logo formats, you can add:
- `logo.svg` - Vector version (edit Navigation.tsx to use .svg instead of .png)
- `logo-light.png` - Light mode version
- `logo-dark.png` - Dark mode version (if you want different logos for dark/light themes)
